# Pathfinder2D
The Pathfinder2D class implements a pathfinding system for a 2D grid-based environment using a weighted graph approach. This class uses the A* (A-star) algorithm to find the shortest path from a start position to a target position. It supports including rectangular grids (both with and without diagonals) and hexagonal grids.
